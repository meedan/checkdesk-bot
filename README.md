Checky, the Checkdesk bot
=========================

Checky listens on Twitter for users sending Checkdesk reports (i.e., media URLs), and responds appropriately. The user can specify a Checkdesk story hashtag to add the report to that specific story.

If the user is known to Checkdesk, submission can be done directly on their behalf. Otherwise, the user is asked to navigate to the report submission form where they have to login/register first before submitting the report themselves.

In case the report already exists in Checkdesk, Checky answers with the report status and a link to it.
